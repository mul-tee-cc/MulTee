#  The flag --disable-new-dtags sets the RPATH to the current directory for all dependencies and overrides LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings
#  The *new* standard behavior is RUNPATH which only searches for direct (non-transitive) deps in the current directory
#  Given that this is a dynmaic link environment I believe we should just rely on LD_LIBRARY_PATH moving forward
